This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Hey there, this is the code behind my portfolio!

I'm glad to see you dropping by to peek at the code, this will be an ever-evolving repository, so much is subject to change as I move elements from hard-coded to Sanity.io.

This portfolio is a NextJs app written in TypeScript, styled with TailwindCSS and DaisyUi.
